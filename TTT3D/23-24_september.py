'''
I suggest that each cell gets points based on how many
diagonals they're a part of. Diagonals go in 4 possible 
directions.
(x,y) -direction
(x,z) -direction
(y,z) -direction
(x,y,z) -direction
Each cell is part of 1,2 or 4 diagonals.


Numbers appearing in 4 diagonals:
{
0,3,12,15,
21,22,25,26,
37,38,41,42,
48,51,60,63
}

Numbers appearing in 2 diagonals:
{
17,18,20,23,24,27,29,30,
33,34,36,39,40,43,45,46
}

Numbers appearing in 1 diagonal:
{
1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,13,14,
16,19,28,31,
32,35,44,47,
49,50,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,61,62
}

I committed two pictures illustrating what I mean :)
